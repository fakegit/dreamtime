<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <summary>Use artificial intelligence to create fake nudes.</summary>
    <description>DreamTime is an application that allows you to easily create fake nudes from a photo using artificial intelligence.

DreamTime's user interface has been created from scratch and is far superior to DeepNude. DreamTime also uses an improved version of the DeepNude algorithm that generates better results.</description>
